The crazy and hilarious adventures of Morten, Thor or Birger in search of his missing cat, Bob, that’s right, Bob the cat. Yup, that is his name; Bob the cat, which is a cat. Bob. The cat. Cat.

Somewhere in a town, far, far away… no wait… it’s right here! Well, whatever, there lives a handsome tall and accomplished man named Morten/ a brute and macho man with a magnificent beard named Thor
(No, not Thor the hammer-wielding God, even though he might look like him)/ an extremely beautiful and
intelligent man with a funny but charming accent named Birger. He is a grade A student, extremely well
fit and one of the most outgoing and popular students at the fantastic university NTNU. One Saturday
he woke up with the worst hangover, due to an epic party hosted by “linjeforeningen Online”.
Yes, it’s in Norwegian, but I challenge you to find an appropriate name for it… Bar association?
Society? Union? Unification? All of the Google Translate suggestions have been checked out, and none of
them seemed fitting, so enough about that ok? Thanks. So, as he got up and out of bed, he waddled around
in his apartment in desperate search of some aspirin and a bottle of soda. As he waddled around… waddle
is a funny word, right? Waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, yeah, I’m hung-over and I know it! 
Hah, awesome remix. Anyhow, during his waddling he was pondering upon where his bad-ass cat with the 
bad-ass name Bob, was. Bob was like his best bud, always following *name* around, wherever he went. 
But strangely, this was not the case today. *Name* called for Bob, searched high and low, but Bob was 
nowhere to be found. This had never happened before, and naturally this concerned *name*. “What could 
possibly have happened to Bob?” *name* thought. “Perhaps he went out to buy me some more soda? 
But that would’ve been weird… I already have a lot of soda in the fridge, he knows that! 
Damn it Bob, where the hell are you dude? I better go search for him…” And so he went out on one of 
the biggest adventures one could possibly imagine:

Bob, that’s’ right, Bob the cat. Yup, that is his name; Bob the cat, which is a cat. Bob. The cat. Cat.
